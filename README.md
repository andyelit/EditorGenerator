# EditorGenerator
A tool that generates custom editors in Unity for an script that is a subclass of `MonoBehaviour` or `ScriptableObject`. 

This is my first foray in code generation, so my code (as well as the generated code) is pretty ugly right now and will probably break easily. This is more of an intitial proof of concept.

## How to use
1. Open the Editor Generator window from the "Tools/Editor Generator" menu item.
2. Drag a script onto the "script" field.
3. Click "Generate" and pick where you want the generated editor to be saved. Remember that custom editors have to be in an Editor folder.
